1. Removing the camshaft in the right way - remove the cam bearings IN PASSES, not unlike how you'd take off the head bolts. Don't just take one bearing off all the way. That may bend you camshaft.
2. Remove your head bolts and re-apply them IN THE RIGHT ORDER or you will warp your head, forcing you to redo this entire job. Also remember to use new head bolts
3. Good sealing techniques - if you don't apply your seals the right way, that includes cam seals, valve stem seals, etc they will leak and you might as well not have done it at all. Look up how to do them correctly
4. Speaking of valve stem seals, you don't need a special tool for the valve keepers. Just a deep socket, vice grip pliers, and an extended magnet tool for removal, plus a piece of cardboard + vice grips + socket for installation
5. You might as well do your timing belt/water pump/crank seal at the same time, since they're right there.
6. Be sure to clean properly your mating surfaces between the head and block, and make sure they are smooth & TOTALLY FLAT down to 2/1000ths of an inch, minimum. Otherwise your head gasket will fail.
