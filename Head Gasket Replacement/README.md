With head lifted up, remove the EGR-VSV valve which is attached to the bottom of the head.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119204229.png)
With this, you can remove the head completely, and pry off the head gasket.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119204424.png)

## Part 2
#### 2.1. Inspect the head gasket for signs of failure.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119204502.png)
Examine the rings for signs of flaking or damage. In the picture above, cylinder one has had some signs of cracking on the ring. This is where water can enter the system.

#### 2.2. Inspect cylinders and block surface.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119204629.png)

#### 2.3. Inspect the bottom of the cylinder head.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119204709.png)
Using a gasket scraper, clean off the remaining gasket residue.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119204744.png)
He also uses a brass wire-wheel with minimal pressure and a solvent to clean. Brass will not scratch the aluminum. Also clean up the valve cover as best as you can.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119204844.png)
Use a straight-edge (as straight as you can get) and check to make sure the head is not warped.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119205034.png)

#### 2.4. Replace the Valves & Stem Seals
Using the valve stem keeper-remover tool, place it on top of the valve and hit it with a hammer. It will compress the spring, allowing the keeper to be extracted. 
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119205810.png)
**The valve will move when you do this, so make sure you have something soft underneath for the valve to hit.**
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119205930.png)
The spring top will come off, and then you can use plyers to remove the keepers.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210034.png)
Turn the head over, and push the valve out.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210115.png)
If the valve needs to be cleaned, use a wire-wheel to brush it. If doing this with a drill or wheel, always keep the valve rotating to avoid burning one side.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210227.png)
Use compressed air to blow out the valve holes.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210252.png)
Use the valve stem seal plyers to remove the old valve stem seal.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210356.png)
Inspect the inside of the bowl to ensure no damage is present.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210534.png)
The new valve stem seals come with a new plastic sleeve. Place them over the top of the valve as to not damage the stem seal.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210654.png)
Put the valve back in.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210705.png)
Put the sleeve over the top.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210841.png)
Put the new valve stem seal and gently squeeze in place. Push down until it bottoms out, then pull off the plastic bit.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210919.png)
Put the valve spring back in place.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119210940.png)
Switch into valve assembly mode and put both keepers in to the valve spring head. Ensure that both are flush. This is easier than putting them into the tool, as it lets you see if you are lined up or not.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119211029.png)
Lineup your assembly tool such that you are pressing directly onto the top of the valve stem.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119211113.png)
Once you've think you have got it aligned, hit it with the hammer. May take a couple tries to get it lined up right. Shouldn't take more than three tries.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119211235.png)
**Repeat steps for remaining valves. Note, some kits may use different seals for intake and exhaust valves.**

#### 2.5.1. Replace Injector Gaskets
Remove the o-ring on the end.
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231119211729.png)

Fill until the coolant is covering the top fin of the radiator. Make sure the drain plug is closed before filling. Squeeze the main radiator hose to try and burp out any bubbles.

Start the engine and continue to burp it through. When the radiator starts to overflow, put the cap back on. Be sure to put the heat on hot to allow coolant to flow through the heater core.
